# Typing Tutor Game

**Typing Tutor Game** is a console-based program designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with different challenges. Players are tested on their typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy, and they receive feedback based on their performance.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels:**
  - **Easy**: 10 randomly generated words to type.
  - **Medium**: 15 randomly generated words to type.
  - **Hard**: 20 randomly generated words to type.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Typing speed (in words per minute)
  - Typing accuracy (percentage)

- **Feedback**: After completing each level, the program shows:
  - Your typing speed in words per minute
  - Your typing accuracy as a percentage
  - Feedback on whether you performed well enough to advance to the next level

## Rules

- **Accuracy** must be above 60% to pass a level.
- **Typing speed** must be above 15 words per minute to pass a level.
